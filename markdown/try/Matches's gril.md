It was terribly cold and nearly dark on the last evening of the old year,and the snow was falling 
fast. In the cold and darkness,a poor little firl with bare head and naked feet,romaed though the 
streets.It is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left home,but they were not of much use.
They were very large,so large,indeed,for they had belonged to her Mother and the poor little girl 
had lost them in running across the street to acoid two carriages that were rolling a terrible rate.

One of the slippres she could not find,and a boy seized the other and ran away with it saying he could 
use it a cradle when he had children of his own. So the little firl went on with her little naked feet,
which were quite red and blue with the cold.In an old apron she carried a number of matches,and had a 
bundle of them in her hands.

No one had bought anythng of her the whole day,nor had anyone given her even a penny.shivering with 
cold and hunger,she crept along,looking like the picture of misery.The snowflkes fell on her fair hair,
which hung in curls on her shoulders,but she regarded them not.
