# The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX

by Tobias Oetiker <tobi@oetiker.ch>

If you want to learn how to write your documents with LaTeX, this introduction is for you. It is not about setting up a LaTeX system. While it is not as comprehensive as Lamport's book, it should be sufficient in most cases.

This repo contains 4 separate areas

* book - the source code for building the lshort book
* intro - a short presentation on latex
* beamer - a sample beamer document
* sample - a sample latex document
